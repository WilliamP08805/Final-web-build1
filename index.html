  <h4>Company History</h4>
  <p>Established in a merger between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995, Lockheed Martin has become one of the most well known U.S based defence companies. On April 22, 1996, Lockheed Martin acquired a large portion of Loral Corporation,the remainder of the corporation became Loral Space & Communications. A proposed merger of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in 1998, fell through when the government addressed concerns of the new group having 25% of the DOD´s procurement budget. In May of 2001 Lockheed sold Lockheed Martin Control Systems to BEA Systems. Also in 2001 Lockheed won the contract to build the F-35 lightning II fighter jet. Near the end of the first decade in the 21st century Lockheed Martin had bought 3Dsolve, Nantero Inc., and Unitech. Additionally the new CEO, Robert Stevens, was able to avert the crisis caused by three quarters of company staff retiring. From 2010 to 2020 Lockheed has continued to grow and acquire other corporations. More recently, Lockheed's share price has continued to grow due to Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Lockheed Martin has incorporated Artificial Intelligence into their products corresponding to the rise in A.I technology. </p>
